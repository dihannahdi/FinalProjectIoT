# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO NOT REMOVE FUNCTION DECLARATIONS

## Why Function Declarations Are Required

The Arduino code contains **function declarations** (also called function prototypes) that are **ESSENTIAL** for compilation. These declarations tell the compiler about functions before they are used.

### ‚ùå DO NOT DELETE THESE LINES:
```cpp
// ===== FUNCTION DECLARATIONS =====
void initializeHardware();
void connectToWiFi();
void checkWiFiConnection();
// ... (and all other function declarations)
```

### üîß Why They're Needed:

1. **Forward Declaration**: In Arduino/C++, functions must be declared before they are called
2. **Our Code Structure**: We call functions in `setup()` and `loop()` that are defined later in the file
3. **Compilation Order**: The compiler reads from top to bottom and needs to know function signatures upfront

### üö® What Happens If You Remove Them:

```
error: 'initializeHardware' was not declared in this scope
error: 'connectToWiFi' was not declared in this scope
error: 'playStartupSound' was not declared in this scope
... (and 25+ other errors)
```

### ‚úÖ Correct File Structure:

```cpp
// 1. Include statements
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
// ...

// 2. Constants and variables
const char* ssid = "...";
// ...

// 3. FUNCTION DECLARATIONS (MUST KEEP!)
void initializeHardware();
void connectToWiFi();
// ... (all other declarations)

// 4. Arduino main functions
void setup() {
  initializeHardware(); // This works because we declared it above
}

void loop() {
  // ...
}

// 5. Function definitions
void initializeHardware() {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### üîí **REMEMBER**: 
- **NEVER** delete the function declarations section
- They are located around line 82-111 in the file
- They start with `// ===== FUNCTION DECLARATIONS =====`
- Without them, the code **WILL NOT COMPILE**

### üìã If You Need to Add New Functions:
1. Add the function declaration in the declarations section
2. Add the function implementation later in the file
3. Both must match exactly (same name, parameters, return type)

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FIXED
The function declarations have been restored and the code should compile successfully.
