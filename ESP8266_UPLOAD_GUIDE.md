# 🎮 ESP8266 Simon Says IoT - Upload Guide

## ✅ **Complete IoT Game Ready!**

I've completely recreated `simon_says_iot_azure/simon_says_iot_azure.ino` with full Azure integration!

## 🚀 **What's New in This Version:**

### **🌐 Full IoT Integration:**
- ✅ WiFi connectivity to your network
- ✅ Real-time communication with Azure server
- ✅ Game trigger detection from web interface
- ✅ Automatic score submission to leaderboard

### **🎯 Complete Game Logic:**
- ✅ Progressive difficulty (10 levels)
- ✅ Score calculation with time bonuses
- ✅ Perfect game tracking
- ✅ Visual and audio feedback
- ✅ Button debouncing and error handling

### **🔧 Hardware Features:**
- ✅ 4 LEDs with different animations
- ✅ 4 buttons with immediate feedback
- ✅ Buzzer with musical notes
- ✅ Status indicators for all states

## 📋 **Required Libraries (Install in Arduino IDE):**

1. **ArduinoJson** by Benoit Blanchon (Version 6.x)
   - Tools → Manage Libraries → Search "ArduinoJson" → Install

2. **ESP8266 Board Package**
   - File → Preferences → Additional Board URLs:
   ```
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
   - Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "ESP8266" → Install

## ⚙️ **Arduino IDE Settings:**
```
Board: NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
CPU Frequency: 80 MHz
Flash Size: 4M (3M SPIFFS)
Upload Speed: 115200
Port: [Your ESP8266 COM port]
```

## 🔌 **Pin Wiring (Already configured in code):**
```
D0 → Buzzer
D1 → Button 1    D5 → LED 1 (Red)
D2 → Button 2    D6 → LED 2 (Green) 
D3 → Button 3    D7 → LED 3 (Blue)
D4 → Button 4    D8 → LED 4 (Yellow)
```

## 🌐 **Network Configuration (Already set):**
```cpp
WiFi: "Bapakmu Ijo" 
Password: "irengputeh"
Server: Your actual Azure URL
```

## 🎮 **How It Works:**

### **1. Device Startup:**
- Tests all hardware (LEDs, buzzer, buttons)
- Connects to WiFi automatically
- Shows ready state with breathing LED effect

### **2. Game Trigger:**
- Device polls Azure server every 2 seconds
- Web interface triggers game for specific player
- ESP8266 receives player name and starts game

### **3. Gameplay:**
- Shows sequence with LEDs and musical notes
- Player repeats sequence using buttons
- Immediate feedback for correct/wrong inputs
- Progressive difficulty (more steps each level)

### **4. Score Submission:**
- Calculates final score with time bonuses
- Submits to Azure leaderboard automatically
- Returns to ready state for next player

## 📤 **Upload Steps:**

1. **Open Arduino IDE**
2. **Open** `simon_says_iot_azure/simon_says_iot_azure.ino`
3. **Install libraries** (ArduinoJson if needed)
4. **Select board and port**
5. **Click Upload** (→ button)
6. **Wait for completion**

## 📊 **Expected Serial Monitor Output:**
```

## 🎯 **Testing Procedure:**

### **1. Hardware Test:**
- All LEDs should flash in sequence
- Buzzer should play different notes
- Buttons should light corresponding LEDs when pressed

### **2. Network Test:**
- WiFi should connect automatically
- Server polling should show in serial monitor
- No error messages should appear

### **3. Game Test:**
- Open Azure web interface
- Enter player name and click "Start Game"
- ESP8266 should receive trigger and start game
- Play through a level and verify score submission

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Compilation Error:**
```
Error: ArduinoJson.h not found
Solution: Install ArduinoJson library via Library Manager
```

### **WiFi Issues:**
```
❌ WiFi connection failed!
Solution: Check network name/password in code
```

### **Server Issues:**
```
⚠️ HTTP Error: 404
Solution: Verify Azure server is running
```
