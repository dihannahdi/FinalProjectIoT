- LEDs show gentle breathing pattern
- Buttons provide immediate feedback

### **2. Game Triggered**
- Web interface triggers game for specific player
- ESP8266 receives player name and starts game
- Game start animation plays

### **3. Gameplay**
- Device shows sequence with LEDs and sounds
- Player repeats sequence using buttons
- Immediate feedback for correct/incorrect inputs
- Progressive difficulty (more steps per level)

### **4. Score Submission**
- Game statistics sent to Azure server
- Score appears on web leaderboard
- Device returns to waiting state

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Compilation Errors:**
```
Error: ArduinoJson.h not found
Solution: Install ArduinoJson library (Version 6.x)
```

### **Upload Errors:**
```
Error: Port not found
Solution: Check USB connection and driver installation
```

### **WiFi Connection Issues:**
```
❌ WiFi connection failed!
Solution: Check SSID/password, network availability
```

### **Server Communication Issues:**
```
⚠️ HTTP Error: 404
Solution: Check Azure server status and URL
```
